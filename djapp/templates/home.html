  <p class="text-md text-gray-400 mt-5">
    Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript
    components, and any other templates for class names, generating the
    corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file. It's fast,
    flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime.
